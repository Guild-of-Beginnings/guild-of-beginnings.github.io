Is Unity a game? Is Fortnite a game engine? Many new game developers often get confused about the differences between games and game engines. To help build a clearer and stronger project, here's a summary of the differences:

# Game Engines

At a fundamental level, game engines are a collection of code, default assets, and small helper tools to assist developers in their process. Commercial engines (such as Unity and Unreal Engine) exist so that developers don't have to recreate core systems every time they make a new game. Some core systems Unity and Unreal Engine provide "out of the box" include:
- Rendering
- Animation
- Building to multiple platforms
- User Input
- User Interface

# Games

A game is the unique experience for the player built on top of the game engine. As an example, games like *Among Us* and *Overcooked!* are both made with the Unity game engine but present two distinct experiences for the player. The game can include custom code, custom models and animations, custom audio, and more. However, it can still rely on fundamental code provided by the engine to expedite the development process.
