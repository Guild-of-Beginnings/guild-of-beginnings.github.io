# What is a Pawn?

By definition, a Pawn in Unreal Engine 5 is any actor that can receive input from a controller. This includes both a player controller and an AI controller. So most characters the player can control or interact with in Unreal Engine are either Pawn objects or Character objects, which inherit from Pawn.
