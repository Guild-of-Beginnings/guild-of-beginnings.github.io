# Unity Engine

Unity is a beginner-friendly [game engine](game-vs-game-engine.md) that uses C# as its primary scripting language. Unity was the foundation for some great AAA games, including *Rust* and *Ori and the Will of the Wisps*. Likewise, Unity has lower technical specification requirements than Unreal Engine, allowing developers to use a wider ariety of development machines.

Unity is used primarily for the following types of projects:
- 2D
- 3D
- Desktop
- Mobile
- Console
- Virtual Reality (VR)
- Mixed Reality (XR)

# Unreal Engine

Unreal Engine is a robust [game engine](game-vs-game-engine.md) that uses C++ as the primary scripting language as well as Blueprint support for visual scripting. Blueprints are well-supported as a visual scripting language, allowing non-programmers easier access to making games. Unreal Engine is a popular choice for both indie and AAA developers, including games like *Rocket League* and *Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order*. Unreal Engine has a slightly more complex editor than Unity but provides great templates to make professional-looking projects from the start.

# Verdict

Either engine will work really well for general 3D game development. They each have their own strengths.

|  | Unity | Unreal |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Beginner-Friendly | Yes! | Not really |
| Development Machine Requirements | Lower requirements | Higher requirements |
| 2D Development | Yes! | Not recommended |
| 3D Development | Yes! | Yes! |
| Programming Language | C# | C++ |
| Visual Scripting | Newer Feature | Better Support |

Go with Unity Engine if:
- You want to focus in 2D or mobile development
- You are more comfortable working with C# than C++
- Your development machine doesn't quite meet the Unreal Engine minimum specifications

Go with Unreal Engine if:
- You prefer visual scripting
- You are more comfortable working with C++ than C#
- Prefer visual scripting instead of writing code

Regardless of which you choose, you can always learn the other later as well.
